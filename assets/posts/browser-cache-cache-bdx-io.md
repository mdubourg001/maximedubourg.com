# Talk: "AmÃ©liorer les performances de nos sites web en jouant Ã  Cache-Cache avec le navigateur" @ BDX I/O 2023

I gave a talk at BDX I/O about caching stuff in the browser!

The title in english can be translated to <b>"Improving the performances of our websites by playing "hide and seek" with the browser"</b> ("hide and seek" is "Cache-Cache" in french, so yeah the title works better in french). I talked about the different caching mechanisms available in the browser, how to use them, and made some live coding to show how they can benefit our websites.

You can find the slides of the talk [here](https://browser-cache-cache.netlify.app/0/) and here's the YouTube video of the talk (yes it is in French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):

<div class="relative w-full overflow-hidden" style="padding-top: 75%;">
  <iframe class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuxUw0Z5QZI?t=8989" title="BDX I/O 2023 - Amphi A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

It was a first for me but I think it went well, and I enjoyed it!

Hope you'll learn something!
