| # | Bug Type (label)                                   | Definition / Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Frequency (among the 1 280 bug reports)                                                                                         | Time-to-fix / Fixing-process Observations                                                                                                                                                                         |
| - | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Configuration issues**                           | Bugs due to mis-configuration: e.g. wrong build setup, incorrect external-library versions or dependencies, wrong paths in config/manifest files, incorrect configuration parameters. ([ResearchGate][1])                                 | One of the more frequent types. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                                       | Has its own characteristic fixing timeline (distinct from other bug types) — time before response, assignment, change, and full fix differ compared to other types. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                     |
| 2 | **Network issues**                                 | Bugs caused by network or inter-component communication problems: e.g. timeouts, protocol misuses, broken connections, network failures or data transfer problems. ([ResearchGate][1])                                                    | Less frequent than core categories (functional, GUI, configuration) but still present. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                | Time-to-fix distribution differs from other types — the fix process shows a distinct profile in how quickly the team responds and resolves. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                             |
| 3 | **Database-related issues**                        | Bugs where interaction with a database fails: e.g. wrong queries, failed DB connections, issues retrieving or storing data, data corruption or inconsistency due to DB operations. ([ResearchGate][1])                                    | Among the less frequent categories in their sample. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                   | Fixing timeline is distinct — from report to response/assignment/change may differ compared to functional or UI bugs. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                                   |
| 4 | **GUI-related issues**                             | Bugs in the user interface: visual/layout problems, incorrect rendering or styling, user-input/UI element misbehavior, graphical or presentation bugs (UI glitches, misaligned controls, wrong UI behavior). ([ResearchGate][1])          | One of the more common bug types among the data set. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                  | The fix process for UI bugs shows characteristic timings; likely moderate compared to functional and security bugs. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                                     |
| 5 | **Performance issues**                             | Bugs that affect performance: e.g. resource leaks (memory, CPU), unresponsive behavior, slow operations, inefficient code paths, high resource consumption or performance bottlenecks. ([ResearchGate][1])                                | Relatively less frequent compared to central categories but present. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                  | Time-to-fix shows a unique distribution — some performance bugs may linger, require more investigation, exhibit variability in fix duration. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                            |
| 6 | **Permission / Deprecation issues** (perm-/depr-)  | Bugs due to the use of deprecated APIs, permission problems, removed APIs or features, or misuse of permissions or outdated interfaces/constructs. ([ResearchGate][1])                                                                    | Among the less frequent types. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                                        | Their fix process timing differs; may be sometimes quicker or slower depending on how clear the deprecation or permission issue is. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                     |
| 7 | **Security issues** (or “security-related issues”) | Bugs that pose security vulnerabilities or weaknesses: e.g. misuses of security-sensitive APIs, improper handling of permissions or authentication, security-related flaws. ([ResearchGate][1])                                           | These are relatively rare compared to functional/UI/config bugs. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                      | Among the fastest to get an initial response: the study notes that security-related bugs have the smallest “time before response” (TBR), often mean and median equal to 2 (very quick). ([azaidman.github.io][2]) |
| 8 | **Program-anomaly (Functional) issues**            | Core logic bugs: flaws in application logic — wrong return values, exceptions, crashes, incorrect behavior not tied to UI / config / performance / DB / network — basically functional errors in application logic. ([ResearchGate][1])   | By far the **most frequent** bug type in the dataset (i.e. functional/program-anomaly bugs dominate). ([azaidman.github.io][2]) | Developers also tend to respond quickly to functional bugs (short delay before first reaction), likely because they directly impact functionality and reliability. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                      |
| 9 | **Test-code–related issues**                       | Bugs located in test code rather than production code: e.g. failing tests, flaky or unreliable tests (e.g. tests that pass/fail unpredictably), broken mocks, incorrect test logic or incorrect test setup/execution. ([ResearchGate][1]) | Less frequent than main categories but part of the 9-type taxonomy. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                   | Test-related bugs also get fairly prompt (relative) attention: despite potentially lower severity, developers react reasonably fast. ([azaidman.github.io][2])                                                    |
