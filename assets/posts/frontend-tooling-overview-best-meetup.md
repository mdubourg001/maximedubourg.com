# Talk: "Cartographier le frontend" @ BEST Meetup #17

I gave a talk last week at BEST Meetup #17, a meetup held ~monthly in ekino's offices.

During this talk, I'm going through the tools that compose the frontend ecosystem and see how they interact with each other. It relies on a graph visualization I made with React Flow that you can find [here](https://frontend-tooling-overview.netlify.app). Here's the YouTube video of the talk (French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·):

Hope you'll learn something!
